Description: A 1D barcode, also known as a linear barcode, is a machine-readable code that represents product information using parallel lines of varying widths. 
It is commonly printed on product packaging and used globally for inventory tracking, retail scanning, and supply chain management. 
Each 1D barcode encodes numeric or alphanumeric data, which is read by optical scanners or cameras. 
These codes help automate the checkout process, manage product identification, and maintain efficient logistics systems. 
The first few digits in this barcode identify the country and company prefix, linking it to registered manufacturers and distributors.
